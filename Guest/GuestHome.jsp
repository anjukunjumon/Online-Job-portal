              <p>The Placement Cell of Ilahia College acts as an integral link between the students and corporate organisations.Ilahia College is one of the first colleges to start a Placement Cell and has facilitated placements for many students. The placement cell functions under the supervision of Mrs.Raji Alias assisted by students and operates all around the year to arrange campus interviews by the companies. The Cell acts as a contact point for all companies that wish to select students from Ilahia College. It facilitates the whole process from collecting the CVs of the students to organising Pre-placement talks by companies to the final induction process.
                  The specially designed courses supplanted with regular revisions and a continuous and vigorous examination pattern is responsible for keeping the students abreast with the new developments in their field of specialization as well as maintaining high academic standards. In addition, the credit system ensures the participation in varied extracurricular activities ranging from sports to fests to NCC to management, you name it! The desire to face competition and succeed is reflected not only in academics as the college is also host to the country's best debaters, sportspersons, artists and budding management mandarins.
In this context the role of the Placement Cell is in the capacity of an aide which hones the skills of the students by conducting seminars and mock GD/PI sessions, rendering them more industry-compatible. The Placement Cell also assists students in crafting their CV's and advises them in clinching a job of their choice.</p>

<p>The Placement Cell is headed by Mrs Nisha Shamshudeen, and Mrs Sheena Jabbar the coordinator. The Cell is led by the Placement officer Mrs. Raji along with the Placement Advisory Board which consists of Professors and final year students from various departments.Initially the companies are invited to take part in the recruitment drive. Those interested respond and thus register with us for the year for recruitment. The students are intimated and a vast number register for the interview.The interview process usually starts with a Power Point Presentation where the company enlightens the students about their company profile. Those interested then go for the interview, which usually comprises of a written test followed by group discussion and personal interview.The job scenario today is facing the onslaught of ground breaking competition from all fields and employment into good companies and organizations has become a daunting task. So, for the benefit of its students preparing to face the job market, the Ilahia College Placement Cell has risen to the occasion and has successfully aided in providing opportunities and employment to its outgoing students.With the relentless support of the staff and the students associated with the placement cell and most significantly Mrs.Raji Alias at the helm, we strive to reach a step closer to our ultimate goal of 100% placements for our students.The student committee has been able to create an extensive database of all the potential recruiting companies along with their contact details. Over the past one year, the cell has been successful in establishing an initial contact with more than five hundred companies. This has definitely increased.The Placement Cell begins the academic year with the process of volunteer recruitment from the first and second year students. The process is conducted by the Core Committee of third year students. Students are then divided into five groups under team leaders, who perform their office and campus duties on different days of the week. Students apply as they want to help out conduct and manage placement activities. The members contact various corporate and human resource personnel regarding the organization of campus drives. Companies begin with the pre-placement talks followed by the group discussion and interview rounds. Once the recruitment process is completed, students are intimated about their selection within suitable time. Different companies may have different selection criteria and processes for students.The Placement Cell reaches out to the students via its Facebook page as well as its Blog.Beside the regular activities Ernst and Young India organised a competition for Btech, MBA and MCA students to write a Business Proposal for an unique startup. More than 150 students were took part in this competition.Like previous years, this year too, we organized various workshops: Workshop by Deloitte International on "Employability and Personal Branding" for the second year students and for the third year students on "Corporate Life and Soft Skill Development". We are thankful to Mr. Kent Francois - Senior Partner US India office, Mr. Sriram Jayaraman - Director External Audit and Mr. Sudipto De - HR Manager. Mr. Sriram and Mr. Sudipto were very eager to help the fellow Xaverian strain up for corporate jobs. Both of them cherish lasting memories of their three years' in Xavier's.A great number of new as well as regular companies visited our college for Placement this year. It started off in August with Futures First being the first, followed by companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Deloitte, KPMG, Ernst & young, Google, Zomato, United bank of Switzerland, Verity Solutions, Axis Bank, Citi Bank, Reckitt Benckiser, MuSigma, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Infosys, Viacom 18, Ogilvy, ICRA, MGH, Mckinsey, Boston Consultancy, Sony India Ltd, Titan, ITC, Z S Associates, Zomato, Addidas, Uber, Grofers and Cognizant. We have placed more than 500 students through on campus drives and off campus interviews from departments like Btech, MBA, MCA,Mtech( Hons..).There is a great deal of enthusiasm among final year students when the placement season starts off. Students come forward with their queries regarding companies, placement procedures and the Placement Cell members readily help them.</p>
<p>This year has been extremely good for placements and with the economic growth reviving; we expect to invite even more companies next year. The support from the College has been extremely encouraging.</p>
